# Lee and Puranam (2016) The implementation imperative: Why one should implement even imperfect strategies perfectly (Strategic Management Journal)

This repository includes a replication package for Lee and Puranam (2016).
Note: There are two typos in the text of the paper: 
-In equation 2, tau should be divided by a scaling factor of 2. 
-In Figure 2a, the mu values are half of what is listed in the legend (i.e. 0, 0.15, 0.35, 0.5).
